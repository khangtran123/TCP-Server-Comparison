Description: This scripts covers the general client that will spawn a bunch of
             other clients to connect to either the multi-threaded, select, or
             epoll servers.

        so getting out of context here. I am getting too hyped with MCU eversince we all went to go see Black Panther. T'Challa was
        such a crazy character and don't even get me started with Erik Killmonger. His character is soo complex. It's like peeling an
        oniong meaning it's just layers and layers of mystery. Everything about that movie is amazing! Empahsizes so much on unity and
        how you use that empowerment to overcome any other obstacles. The point I wanted to get out was just a simple hello! I must
        say that the MCU have really outdone themself with the expansion of the team. Like come on! Who isn't excited for the new
        Infinity War against the almighty Thanos, the destroyer and true ruler of the universe.  Once he has all the infinity stones
        that dude would be unstoppable no matter how big the team is. Disney is just a monster house buying every company there is.
        Good job to them and bad job with Star Wars: The Last Jedi LIKE COME ON!!!!!"""
