"""Hey there server. It's me, your friendly neighbour Spiderman. Wait is that even right? Spiderman is the
    most insane character in the MCU and come on.... Peter Parker is awesome especially his relationship with Mary Jane! I am
    so getting out of context here. I am getting too hyped with MCU eversince we all went to go see Black Panther. T'Challa was
    such a crazy character and don't even get me started with Erik Killmonger. His character is soo complex. It's like peeling an
    oniong meaning it's just layers and layers of mystery. Everything about that movie is amazing! Empahsizes so much on unity and
    how you use that empowerment to overcome any other obstacles. The point I wanted to get out was just a simple hello! I must
    say that the MCU have really outdone themself with the expansion of the team. Like come on! Who isn't excited for the new
    Infinity War against the almighty Thanos, the destroyer and true ruler of the universe.  Once he has all the infinity stones
    that dude would be unstoppable no matter how big the team is. Disney is just a monster house buying every company there is.
    Good job to them and bad job with Star Wars: The Last Jedi LIKE COME ON!!!!!"""
